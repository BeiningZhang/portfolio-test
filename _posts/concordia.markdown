description: In collaboration with colleagues from Google DeepMind, MIT, UC Berkeley, and UCL, the Cooperative AI Foundation is excited to present the Concordia Contest as part of NeurIPS 2024. This contest challenges participants to advance the cooperative intelligence of language model (LM) agents in rich, text-based environments, based on the recently released Concordia framework which uses language models to create open-ended worlds similar to tabletop role-playing games.
